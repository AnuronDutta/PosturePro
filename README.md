# PosturePro: Posture Monitoring App



## Overview

PosturePro is a posture monitoring application designed to help you maintain a healthy posture. This distribution includes the executable file (`PosturePro.exe`) for easy installation and usage.

## Features

- **Real-time Posture Monitoring**: PosturePro continuously tracks your body's key landmarks to evaluate your posture.

- **Perfect Posture Calibration**: Set your perfect posture angle by pressing 'P' when you're in an ideal position. The application will then monitor and provide feedback based on this reference angle.

- **Adjustable Thresholds**: Customize the sensitivity of the posture monitoring system by adjusting the deviation angle and time thresholds.

- **Posture Alerts**: Receive visual and audible alerts if your posture deviates significantly from the calibrated perfect posture for an extended duration.

- **Pause/Resume Video Feed**: Conveniently pause and resume the video feed using the 'Esc' key, allowing you to temporarily disable posture monitoring.

## Controls

- **'P' Key**: Set or reset your perfect posture angle. Press 'P' again to re-record when needed.

- **'Esc' Key**: Toggle pause and resume for the video feed. Useful when you need a break from posture monitoring.

- **'I' and 'O' Keys**: Adjust the deviation angle threshold. Press 'I' to decrease and 'O' to increase.

- **'K' and 'L' Keys**: Adjust the time threshold for posture alerts. Press 'K' to decrease and 'L' to increase.

- **'Q' Key**: Quit the application.

2. **Run the Application**:
